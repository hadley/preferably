\description{
An accessible template for pkgdown websites with dynamic light/dark mode
support
}
\details{
This is an accessible template for 'pkgdown'. It
uses two bootstrap themes, Flatly and Darkly and utilizes the
'prefers-color-scheme' CSS variable to automatically serve either of
the two based on users' operating system setting, or allowing them to
manually toggle between them.
